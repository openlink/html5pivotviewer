The HTML5 PivotViewer is a fork of a project that was started
by LobsterPot Solutions as a cross browser, cross platform version
of the Silverlight PivotViewer control produced by Microsoft. The
control was written as a jQuery plug-in and utilises features
available in HTML5.

As LobsterPot Solutions stopped enhancing their GPL v2 based version
in favour of a closed source version, OpenLink Software decided to
invest resources into continuing to enhance the open source version
of this work.

OpenLink Software converted this project which was originally hosted
on Codeplex using Mercurial into Git and will continue to maintain
it on GitHub in the hope it will attract contributions from the
larger open source community.

This project is a fork of the OpenLink Software project by the original 
developer Roger Noble. The aim of this fork is to simplify the project 
and leverage node.js for development and build.
