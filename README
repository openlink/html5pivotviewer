The HTML5 PivotViewer is a fork of a project that was started
by LobsterPot Solutions as a cross browser, cross platform version
of the Silverlight PivotViewer control produced by Microsoft. The
control was written as a jQuery plug-in and utilises features
available in HTML5.

As LobsterPot Solutions stopped enhancing their GPL v2 based version
in favour of a closed source version, OpenLink Software decided to
invest resources into continuing to enhance the open source version
of this work.

OpenLink Software converted this project which was originally hosted
on Codeplex using Mercurial into Git and will continue to maintain
it on GitHub in the hope it will attract contributions from the
larger open source community.

A built version of this project containing pivotviewer.js and pivotviewer.min.js can be downloaded as either a zip or a compressed tar archive from:
